# User-Management-System
The Servlet User Management Project is a web application designed to provide a robust and secure platform for managing user accounts and access within an organization or an online system. Developed using Java Servlet technology, this project focuses on user authentication, authorization, and user profile management.

Key Features:

User Registration and Authentication: The project allows users to register for an account securely and authenticate themselves during login. Servlets handle the user authentication process, ensuring that only authorized users gain access to the system.

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Role-based access control is implemented to categorize users into different roles, each with specific permissions and access levels. Servlets manage the authorization process, ensuring that users can only perform actions associated with their assigned roles.

User Profile Management: Users can view and update their profiles, including personal information, contact details, and password changes. Servlets and JSP pages work together to create a seamless and user-friendly profile management experience.

Password Security: The project employs secure password storage techniques, such as encryption and hashing, to protect user credentials. This ensures that sensitive information remains confidential and secure.

Session Management: Servlets handle session management to keep track of user sessions, providing a secure and efficient way to maintain user state throughout their interactions with the application.

User Administration Panel: Administrators have access to a dedicated admin panel where they can manage user accounts, assign roles, and perform other administrative tasks. Servlets are responsible for processing these administrative actions.

Database Connectivity: The project integrates with a relational database using JDBC, allowing for the storage and retrieval of user information. This ensures data persistence and supports scalability as the user base grows.

Security Measures: The application incorporates security best practices, including input validation, protection against common web vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting), and other measures to safeguard against unauthorized access and data breaches.

Responsive Design: The user interface is designed to be responsive, allowing users to access the application from various devices and screen sizes without compromising usability.

The Servlet User Management Project is a versatile solution that can be adapted for intranet systems, online platforms, or any environment where user accounts need to be managed securely and efficiently. It provides a foundation for building scalable and secure web applications with a focus on user identity and access management.
